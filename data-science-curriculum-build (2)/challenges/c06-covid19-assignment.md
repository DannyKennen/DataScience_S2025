*Purpose*: In this challenge, you’ll learn how to navigate the U.S.
Census Bureau website, programmatically download data from the internet,
and perform a county-level population-weighted analysis of current
COVID-19 trends. This will give you the base for a very deep
investigation of COVID-19, which we’ll build upon for Project 1.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

*Background*:
[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) is
the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. In 2020 it became a global
pandemic, leading to huge loss of life and tremendous disruption to
society. The New York Times (as of writing) publishes up-to-date data on
the progression of the pandemic across the United States—we will study
these data in this challenge.

*Optional Readings*: I’ve found this [ProPublica
piece](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-understand-covid-19-numbers)
on “How to understand COVID-19 numbers” to be very informative!

# The Big Picture

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

We’re about to go through *a lot* of weird steps, so let’s first fix the
big picture firmly in mind:

We want to study COVID-19 in terms of data: both case counts (number of
infections) and deaths. We’re going to do a county-level analysis in
order to get a high-resolution view of the pandemic. Since US counties
can vary widely in terms of their population, we’ll need population
estimates in order to compute infection rates (think back to the
`Titanic` challenge).

That’s the high-level view; now let’s dig into the details.

# Get the Data

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

1.  County-level population estimates (Census Bureau)
2.  County-level COVID-19 counts (New York Times)

## Navigating the Census Bureau

<!-- ------------------------- -->

**Steps**: Our objective is to find the 2018 American Community
Survey\[1\] (ACS) Total Population estimates, disaggregated by counties.
To check your results, this is Table `B01003`.

1.  Go to [data.census.gov](data.census.gov).
2.  Scroll down and click `View Tables`.
3.  Apply filters to find the ACS **Total Population** estimates,
    disaggregated by counties. I used the filters:

- `Topics > Populations and People > Counts, Estimates, and Projections > Population Total`
- `Geography > County > All counties in United States`

5.  Select the **Total Population** table and click the `Download`
    button to download the data; make sure to select the 2018 5-year
    estimates.
6.  Unzip and move the data to your `challenges/data` folder.

- Note that the data will have a crazy-long filename like
  `ACSDT5Y2018.B01003_data_with_overlays_2020-07-26T094857.csv`. That’s
  because metadata is stored in the filename, such as the year of the
  estimate (`Y2018`) and my access date (`2020-07-26`). **Your filename
  will vary based on when you download the data**, so make sure to copy
  the filename that corresponds to what you downloaded!

### **q1** Load Table `B01003` into the following tibble. Make sure the column names are `id, Geographic Area Name, Estimate!!Total, Margin of Error!!Total`.

*Hint*: You will need to use the `skip` keyword when loading these data!

``` r
## TASK: Load the census bureau data with the following tibble name.
pop <- "./data/ACSDT5Y2018.B01003-Data.csv"
df_pop <- read_csv(
  pop,
  skip = 2, 
  na = "*****", 
  col_types = "ccd_d__",
  col_names = c("id", 
                "Geographic Area Name", 
                "Estimate!!Total",
                "Margin of Error!!Total")
  )
```

    ## Warning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,
    ## e.g.:
    ##   dat <- vroom(...)
    ##   problems(dat)

``` r
head(df_pop)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 4
    ##   id             `Geographic Area Name` `Estimate!!Total` Margin of Error!!Tot…¹
    ##   <chr>          <chr>                              <dbl>                  <dbl>
    ## 1 0500000US01001 Autauga County, Alaba…             55200                     NA
    ## 2 0500000US01003 Baldwin County, Alaba…            208107                     NA
    ## 3 0500000US01005 Barbour County, Alaba…             25782                     NA
    ## 4 0500000US01007 Bibb County, Alabama               22527                     NA
    ## 5 0500000US01009 Blount County, Alabama             57645                     NA
    ## 6 0500000US01011 Bullock County, Alaba…             10352                     NA
    ## # ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Margin of Error!!Total`

*Note*: You can find information on 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates
[here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html).
The punchline is that 5-year estimates are more reliable but less
current.

## Automated Download of NYT Data

<!-- ------------------------- -->

ACS 5-year estimates don’t change all that often, but the COVID-19 data
are changing rapidly. To that end, it would be nice to be able to
*programmatically* download the most recent data for analysis; that way
we can update our analysis whenever we want simply by re-running our
notebook. This next problem will have you set up such a pipeline.

The New York Times is publishing up-to-date data on COVID-19 on
[GitHub](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

### **q2** Visit the NYT [GitHub](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) repo and find the URL for the **raw** US County-level data. Assign that URL as a string to the variable below.

``` r
## TASK: Find the URL for the NYT covid-19 county-level data
url_counties <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv"
```

Once you have the url, the following code will download a local copy of
the data, then load the data into R.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this; just execute
## Set the filename of the data to download
filename_nyt <- "./data/nyt_counties.csv"

## Download the data locally
curl::curl_download(
        url_counties,
        destfile = filename_nyt
      )

## Loads the downloaded csv
df_covid <- read_csv(filename_nyt)
```

    ## Rows: 2502832 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr  (3): county, state, fips
    ## dbl  (2): cases, deaths
    ## date (1): date
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

You can now re-run the chunk above (or the entire notebook) to pull the
most recent version of the data. Thus you can periodically re-run this
notebook to check in on the pandemic as it evolves.

*Note*: You should feel free to copy-paste the code above for your own
future projects!

# Join the Data

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

To get a sense of our task, let’s take a glimpse at our two data
sources.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this; just execute
df_pop %>% glimpse
```

    ## Rows: 3,220
    ## Columns: 4
    ## $ id                       <chr> "0500000US01001", "0500000US01003", "0500000U…

    ## Rows: 2,502,832
    ## Columns: 6
    ## $ date   <date> 2020-01-21, 2020-01-22, 2020-01-23, 2020-01-24, 2020-01-24, 20…

    ## $ fips   <chr> "53061", "53061", "53061", "17031", "53061", "06059", "17031", …
    ## $ cases  <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …
    ## $ deaths <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …

To join these datasets, we’ll need to use [FIPS county
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code).\[2\] The last
`5` digits of the `id` column in `df_pop` is the FIPS county code, while
the NYT data `df_covid` already contains the `fips`.

### **q3** Process the `id` column of `df_pop` to create a `fips` column.

``` r
## TASK: Create a `fips` column by extracting the county code

df_q3 <- 
  df_pop %>%
  mutate(fips = str_extract(id, "\\d{5}$"))
 # pattern = "\\d{2}"
df_q3
```

    ## # A tibble: 3,220 × 5

    ##    <chr>   <chr>                              <dbl>                  <dbl> <chr>

    ##  2 050000… Baldwin County, Alaba…            208107                     NA 01003

    ## # ℹ 3,210 more rows
    ## # ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Margin of Error!!Total`

Use the following test to check your answer.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Check known county
assertthat::assert_that(
              (df_q3 %>%
              filter(str_detect(`Geographic Area Name`, "Autauga County")) %>%
              pull(fips)) == "01001"
            )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Very good!")
```

    ## [1] "Very good!"

### **q4** Join `df_covid` with `df_q3` by the `fips` column. Use the proper type of join to preserve *only* the rows in `df_covid`.

``` r
## TASK: Join df_covid and df_q3 by fips.
df_q4 <- left_join(df_covid, df_q3, by = "fips")
```

Use the following test to check your answer.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
if (!any(df_q4 %>% pull(fips) %>% str_detect(., "02105"), na.rm = TRUE)) {
  assertthat::assert_that(TRUE)
} else {
  print(str_c(
    "Your df_q4 contains a row for the Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (AK),",
    "which is not in df_covid. You used the incorrect join type.",
    sep = " "
  ))
  assertthat::assert_that(FALSE)
}
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
if (any(df_q4 %>% pull(fips) %>% str_detect(., "78010"), na.rm = TRUE)) {
  assertthat::assert_that(TRUE)
} else {
  print(str_c(
    "Your df_q4 does not include St. Croix, US Virgin Islands,",
    "which is in df_covid. You used the incorrect join type.",
    sep = " "
  ))
  assertthat::assert_that(FALSE)
}
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Very good!")
```

    ## [1] "Very good!"

For convenience, I down-select some columns and produce more convenient
column names.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this to produce a more convenient tibble
df_data <-
  df_q4 %>%
  select(
    date,
    county,
    state,
    fips,
    cases,
    deaths,
    population = `Estimate!!Total`
  )
```

# Analyze

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now that we’ve done the hard work of loading and wrangling the data, we
can finally start our analysis. Our first step will be to produce county
population-normalized cases and death counts. Then we will explore the
data.

## Normalize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q5** Use the `population` estimates in `df_data` to normalize `cases` and `deaths` to produce per 100,000 counts \[3\]. Store these values in the columns `cases_per100k` and `deaths_per100k`.

``` r
## TASK: Normalize cases and deaths
df_normalized <-
  df_data %>%
  filter(population > 0) %>%
  mutate(cases_per100k = (cases / population) * 100000,
         deaths_per100k = (deaths / population) * 100000
  ) 

df_normalized
```

## Guided EDA

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Before turning you loose, let’s complete a couple guided EDA tasks.

### **q6** Compute some summaries

Compute the mean and standard deviation for `cases_per100k` and
`deaths_per100k`. *Make sure to carefully choose **which rows** to
include in your summaries,* and justify why!

``` r
## TASK: Compute mean and sd for cases_per100k and deaths_per100k
# Compute the most recent entry per county
# Compute the most recent entry per county
df_q6 <- df_normalized %>%
  group_by(fips) %>%
  filter(date == max(date)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Compute summary statistics
summary_stats <- df_q6 %>%
  summarize(
    mean_cases_per100k = mean(cases_per100k, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_cases_per100k = sd(cases_per100k, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_deaths_per100k = mean(deaths_per100k, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_deaths_per100k = sd(deaths_per100k, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

summary_stats
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   mean_cases_per100k sd_cases_per100k mean_deaths_per100k sd_deaths_per100k
    ##                <dbl>            <dbl>               <dbl>             <dbl>
    ## 1             24774.            6233.                375.              160.

- Which rows did you pick?
  - The most recent row for each county
- Why?
  - Because with the most recent information we have a fuller picture
    than using older data, and it makes sure that all the counties have
    the same amount of representation because we are only taking the
    latest amount of information and not looking at timelines

### **q7** Find and compare the top 10

Find the top 10 counties in terms of `cases_per100k`, and the top 10 in
terms of `deaths_per100k`. Report the population of each county along
with the per-100,000 counts. Compare the counts against the mean values
you found in q6. Note any observations.

``` r
## TASK: Find the top 10 max cases_per100k counties; report populations as well
df_top10_cases <- 
  df_normalized %>% 
  group_by(county) %>% 
  summarise(across(c(state, population, cases_per100k, deaths_per100k, date), max)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cases_per100k)) %>% 
  slice(0:10)

df_top10_cases
```

**Observations**:

- Texas and Alaska are the 2 main states for the top 10 ten cases. Texas
  shows up again repeatedly for the top ten counties with deaths,
  especially Loving. Loving probably shows up in both because it’s
  population is so small any cases and deaths have carry a bigger
  percentage of the population then other counties.
- Between both cases, the largest population is 75,690 in Hancock, VA.
  The majority of the other places are under 20K and all of them are
  under 100K, these are all relatively small places
- When did these “largest values” occur?
  - Loving, Texas shows up in both the cases and deaths set as an
    outlier in 05/13/2022.

## Self-directed EDA

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q8** Drive your own ship: You’ve just put together a very rich dataset; you now get to explore! Pick your own direction and generate at least one punchline figure to document an interesting finding. I give a couple tips & ideas below:

### Ideas

<!-- ------------------------- -->

- Look for outliers.
- Try web searching for news stories in some of the outlier counties.
- Investigate relationships between county population and counts.
- Do a deep-dive on counties that are important to you (e.g. where you
  or your family live).
- Fix the *geographic exceptions* noted below to study New York City.
- Your own idea!

**DO YOUR OWN ANALYSIS HERE**

### Aside: Some visualization tricks

``` r
# Summarize each county by its max cases_per100k over time
df_q8_scatter <- df_normalized %>%
  group_by(county, state, population) %>%
  summarise(max_cases_per100k = max(cases_per100k, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Plot
ggplot(df_q8_scatter, aes(x = population, y = max_cases_per100k)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "COVID-19 Cases vs. County Population",
    x = "Population (log scale)",
    y = "Cases per 100,000 (log scale)"
  )
```

![](c06-covid19-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations:  
-** This visual shows the relationships between population size and the
number of cases per 100,000 (I had to put y in log scale as well as x
because the two outliers on the low population size made all of the
other parts be super condensed together.)  
- There honestly doesn’t seem to be as strong a correlation between
higher popluations and higher cases like I thought there would be. They
are relatively condensed in one area and the variation in that area
doesn’t seem to be affected much by population size.

- There is a group in between 1000 and 100,000 in population that has a
  higher cases per 100K ratio than the surrounding counties which is
  interesting

- There are two super outlier counties, both of them are the two
  smallest in terms of population size but one has the highest amount of
  cases and one has the lowest, both to pretty extreme standards where
  no other counties are near their numbers.

<!-- ------------------------- -->

These data get a little busy, so it’s helpful to know a few `ggplot`
tricks to help with the visualization. Here’s an example focused on
Massachusetts.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this; just an example
# df_normalized %>%
#   filter(
#     state == "Massachusetts", # Focus on Mass only
#     !is.na(fips), # fct_reorder2 can choke with missing data
#   ) %>%
# 
#   ggplot(
#     aes(date, cases_per100k, color = fct_reorder2(county, date, cases_per100k))
#   ) +
#   geom_line() +
#   scale_y_log10(labels = scales::label_number_si()) +
#   scale_color_discrete(name = "County") +
#   theme_minimal() +
#   labs(
#     x = "Date",
#     y = "Cases (per 100,000 persons)"
#   )

## This was giving me errors for some reason:
# Error:
# ! `label_number_si()` was deprecated in scales 1.2.0 and is now defunct.
# ℹ Please use the `scale_cut` argument of `label_number()` instead.
```

*Tricks*:

- I use `fct_reorder2` to *re-order* the color labels such that the
  color in the legend on the right is ordered the same as the vertical
  order of rightmost points on the curves. This makes it easier to
  reference the legend.
- I manually set the `name` of the color scale in order to avoid
  reporting the `fct_reorder2` call.
- I use `scales::label_number_si` to make the vertical labels more
  readable.
- I use `theme_minimal()` to clean up the theme a bit.
- I use `labs()` to give manual labels.

### Geographic exceptions

<!-- ------------------------- -->

The NYT repo documents some [geographic
exceptions](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data#geographic-exceptions);
the data for New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Richmond counties are
consolidated under “New York City” *without* a fips code. Thus the
normalized counts in `df_normalized` are `NA`. To fix this, you would
need to merge the population data from the New York City counties, and
manually normalize the data.
