*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

``` r
df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

- Class - Where they the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or crew, class?
- Sex - Were they Male or Female?
- Age - Were they an adult or a child?
- Survived - Did they survive or not?
- n - the number of people who fall into any given category

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Are there any differences?
  - The Wikipedia article says there were an estimated 2,224 passengers,
    compared to the 2,201 that computation said. That’s a difference of
    23 passengers.
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - The estimates for passengers and death tolls vary from sources
    because some passengers traveled under aliases and also records may
    have

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_survived <- df_titanic %>% filter(Survived == "Yes")
df_survived %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex), position = "dodge")
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The 3rd class was pretty evenly split between females and males who
  survived.
- Every class other then crew have more women who survived then men,
  it’s likely that the reason this trend doesn’t continue for the crew
  is because the crew were almost fully men.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # ℹ 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_survived <- df_prop %>% filter(Survived == "Yes")
df_survived %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex), position = "dodge")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here.
  - The crew’s survival rates essentially switch when we measure it
    proportionally. The majority of the women on the crew survived and
    the majority of men on the crew died, there were just so few women
    that even though the majority of the male crew died, the actual
    number of men who survived is much higher then the women on the
    crew.
  - Women in the 3rd class had a higher rate of survival the men (even
    though over half of them died), there were just likely more men in
    3rd class then women so numerically their survival rates look almost
    even.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - It says that 100% of both women and men in 1st and 2nd class. This
    probably has something to do with the survival rate of children in
    first and second class and the fact their survival rates are lumped
    together with the adults in this plot.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_survived <- df_prop %>% filter(Survived == "Yes", Age == "Adult")

df_survived %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(
    mapping = aes(x = Class, y = Prop , fill = Sex),
    position = "dodge")
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - When we filter out children, we can see that the rates for male
    survivors goes down on all classes except for crew. The survival
    rate for females also decreases in every class except for crew, but
    by less because women were still prioritized much more then men in
    the evacuation. In this new plot we can see that even women in the
    3rd class, who had a less then half chance at survival, still
    survived at a rate higher then every class of men.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
